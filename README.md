# Dementia-Predictive-Model
Feature Importance based Dementia Predictive Model - Developed by Ankita Das

This repository contains all codes related to a predictive dementia model using machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, Decision Tree and XGBoost.
Important features of dementia detetction are analyzed using SHAP.

The dementia_dataset.csv file contains the dementia dataset used in the predictive dementia models.

These files can be run in Colab/Jupyter notebook.

The dementia folder contains three python files: decisiontree.py,randomforest.py, xgboost.py .

The decisiontree.py file contains the code for the Decision Tree Classifier.

The randomforest.py file contains the code for the Random Forest Classifier.

The xgboost.py file contains the code for the XGBoost Classifier.

The shapdementia folder contains three python files: shapdt.py, shaprf.py, shapxg.py .

The shapdt.py file contains the code for the shap plots and visualization for Decision Tree Classifier.

The shaprf.py file contains the code for the shap plots and visualization for Random Forest Classifier.

The shapxg.py file contains the code for the shap plots and visualization for XGBoost Classifier.
