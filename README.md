# Dementia-Predictive-Model
Feature Importance based Dementia Predictive Model.

This repository contains all codes related to a predictive dementia model using machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, Decision Tree and XGBoost.
Important features of dementia detetction are analyzed using SHAP.

The dementia_dataset.csv file contains the dementia dataset used in the predictive dementia models.

These files can be run in Colab/Jupyter notebook.

The dementia-rf.py file contains the code for the Random Forest Classifier.

The dementia-dt.py file contains the code for the Decision Tree Classifier.

The dementia-xg.py file contains the code for the XGBoost Classifier.


The shapdementia-rf.py file contains the code for the shap plots and visualization for Random Forest Classifier.

The shapdementia-dt.py file contains the code for the shap plots and visualization for Decision Tree Classifier.

The shapdementia-xg.py file contains the code for the shap plots and visualization for XGBoost Classifier.
